Neovim Configuration

This repository contains my custom Neovim configuration, designed for an optimized and modern development experience. It leverages Lua for plugin management and configuration using Lazy.nvim, providing a clean and modular setup for easier customization.

Features:

	•	Catppuccin Theme for a visually appealing interface.
	•	Neo-tree for intuitive file navigation and management.
	•	Bufferline for efficient buffer management with a clean UI.
	•	LSP Integration for language server support, including diagnostics, autocompletion, and formatting.
	•	Telescope for fuzzy file searching and quick project navigation.
	•	Treesitter for advanced syntax highlighting.
	•	Git Integration with Gitsigns for inline Git information.
	•	Lualine for a customized statusline.
	•	Snippets support using LuaSnip.
	•	Markdown Support with improved preview and functionality.

How to Use:

	1.	Clone the repository into your Neovim config directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/nvim-config ~/.config/nvim
```
    2. Open Neovim and run:
```bash
:Lazy sync
```
This will install all the plugins and apply the configuration.
